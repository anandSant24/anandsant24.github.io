/* boilerplate header-main-footer template
main :

1. Problem with simply using float:left was that the first element alignment breaks
so we need to update @media only scree and (min-width:600){
    width:50%;
    display:inline-block;
    vertical-align:top;
}
another Problem that comes after solving this is 4th div moves down so 
make div ul and add css list-style-type:none(ie. use css class ul-base)
and for inner div change it to li 
. notices the removal of </li> ending li tag
it is a hack to remove the unwanted padding created and also use of ul and li instead of div to remove
unwanted spacing so that 4 blocks each 25% fit in first row itself;
